# TCD-Editor
A graphical editor to generate templates for a Teensy driven HMI display.

You may find a [test version](https://github.com/mamuesp/TCD-Editor/releases/download/PropEditAlpha/TCD_Editor.jar) here under "releases". This software comes with no warranty of any kind "as is", you may use it freely, but on your own risk.

## How to start:

* on Mac OS X: just download the jar file to a location of your choice and doubleclick it - the application will start.
* on Windows/Linux: download the jar file as well, then open a command/terminal-window and change to the directory, where the jar file is stored. Then you enter "java -jar TCD-Editor.jar" - and if all is correctly installed, the application starts from here. You may also enter "java -jar <full path to file>TCD-Editor.jar" if you want to start from another direcory.
 
As the application is developed under JavaFX, you need at least **Java 8** to be able to use the editor.
